# LangChain Documentation Helper

<img src="https://github.com/SueGK/documentation-helper/blob/local-docker/Bot.gif" width="650" height="650"/>

## Overview

The LangChain Documentation Helper, built with Langchain, pinecone and streamlit, is a web-based application designed to facilitate learning and exploration of LangChain by leveraging generative AI. By integrating with Pinecone, a vector database, this application provides an efficient and intuitive way to query and interact with LangChain's official documentation.

## Environment Setup

To securely manage application configurations and sensitive credentials, this project uses environment variables stored in a .env file at the root of the project directory. Before running the application, you must create this file and populate it with the necessary keys.

**env File Contents**

Your .env file should contain the following key-value pairs:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
PINECONE_API_KEY='your_pinecone_api_key_here'
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT_REGION='your_pinecone_region_here'
```
> Please ensure that your .env file is never committed to your version control system. Add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent accidental uploads of sensitive information.
